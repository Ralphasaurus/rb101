Outline:
1. a method that returns the sum of two integers
2. a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together
3. a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element

INFORMAL:

1. 
ask the user for input
store input in a variables
write method to add the numbers together and return the result

2. 
an array of strings stored in a variable
join the strings 
print result

3.
an array of integers in a variable
iterate over the array one by one
use the index numbers of the array to pop off each odd one (or even)
return the result

FORMAL:

3. 

START	-given a collection of integers...

SET	    -set the array into a variable
        -set the interator counter to 0

LOGIC   -while counter != array.length do... 
        -remove array[1]
        -increment counter
        -if counter == array.length break the while loop and print the array

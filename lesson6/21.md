Black Jack!

high level psuedo code:
1. Initialize deck
  - need to pick a data structure to represent the deck
  - 52 cards: 2-10, JACK, QUEEN, KING, ACE (hearts, diamonds, spades, clubs)
  - Each card has a value: Aces will either have value of 1 or 11
  - a method will be needed to determine the Ace value
2. Deal cards to player and dealer
  - dealer and player both start the game with 2 cards at random
3. Player turn: hit or stay
  - repeat until bust or "stay"
4. If player bust, dealer wins.
5. Dealer turn: hit or stay
  - repeat until total >= 17
6. If dealer bust, player wins.
7. Compare cards and declare winner.

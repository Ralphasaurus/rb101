# The defensive minded AI is pretty cool, but it's still not performing
# as well as it could because if there are no impending threats, it will
# pick a square at random. We'd like to make a slight improvement on that.
# We're not going to add in any complicated algorithm (there's an extra bonus
# below on that), but all we want to do is piggy back on our
# find_at_risk_square from bonus #3 above and turn it into an attacking
# mechanism as well. The logic is simple: if the computer already has 2
# in a row, then fill in the 3rd square, as opposed to moving at random.

# // if computer already has 2 in a row
# // fill in 3rd square instead of randomly

# The computer currently picks a square at random. That's not very
# interesting. Let's make the computer defensive minded, so that if there's
# an immediate threat, then it will defend the 3rd square. We'll consider an
# "immediate threat" to be 2 squares marked by the opponent in a row. If
# there's no immediate threat, then it will just pick a random square.

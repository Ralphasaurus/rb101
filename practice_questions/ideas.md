*Ideas for coding problems*

-write a method accepts one string as a parameter and determines if it is a palidrome

-Write a method that takes two parameters, an array and an integer, and have it return
whether any two numbers in the array add up to the given integer.

-Write a method that takes an array and returns groups of words that are anagrams.
Anagrams are words that have the same exact letters in them but in a different order.

*Study !!*

-Need to study up/practice:
      - the format method
      - regex
      - be aware of constants and when to use them

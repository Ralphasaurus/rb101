*Problem*
Write a method that takes one argument, a positive integer, and returns a string of 
alternating 1s and 0s, always starting with 1.
The length of the string should match the given integer.
The test cases below should all print true.

*Examples and Test Cases*
puts stringy(6) == '101010'    => true
puts stringy(9) == '101010101' => true
puts stringy(4) == '1010'      => true
puts stringy(7) == '1010101'   => true

*Data Structures and Algorithms*
  input: one argument which is a positive integer
  output: a string of alternating 1's and 0's starting with 1, matching the length of input.

1. define method called stringy that takes one argument
2.

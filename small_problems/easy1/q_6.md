*Problem*
Write a method that takes one argument, a string containing one or more words, 
and returns the given string with words that contain five or more characters reversed. 
Each string will consist of only letters and spaces.
Spaces should be included only when more than one word is present.

Rules:
  -method takes one argument, a string
  -string can contain one or more words
  -return the given string, any words 5 or more characters must be reversed

*Examples and Test Cases*
puts reverse_words('Professional')          # => lanoisseforP
puts reverse_words('Walk around the block') # => Walk dnuora the kcolb
puts reverse_words('Launch School')         # => hcnuaL loohcS

*Data Structures and Algorithms*
# 1. use split method on string to create an array of strings and assign it to a variable
# 2. iterate over the array
# 3. if the array contains words with 5 characters or more reverse them
# 4. join the strings back together
# 5. return the string

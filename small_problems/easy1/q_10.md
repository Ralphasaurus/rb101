*Problem*
Write a method that takes two arguments, a positive integer and a boolean, and calculates
the bonus for a given salary.
If the boolean is true, the bonus should be half of the salary. 
If the boolean is false, the bonus should be 0.
The tests below should print true.

Rules: 
-input: a positive integer and a boolean
-output: if boolean true bonus that is equal to half the salary 
         if boolean false bonus is 0
*Examples and Test Cases*
puts calculate_bonus(2800, true) == 1400
puts calculate_bonus(1000, false) == 0
puts calculate_bonus(50000, true) == 25000

*Data Structures and Algorithms*
1. define method that takes 2 arguments
2. if bonus is true return half of the salary
3. else return 0

*Problem*
Write a method that takes one argument, a positive integer, and returns the sum of its digits.
The tests below should print true.

For a challenge, 
try writing this without any basic looping constructs (while, until, loop, and each).

*Examples and Test Cases*
puts sum(23) == 5
puts sum(496) == 19
puts sum(123_456_789) == 45

*Data Structures and Algorithms*
1. Define a method called sum that takes one argument, a positive integer
2. add the integer's together 
3. return the sum

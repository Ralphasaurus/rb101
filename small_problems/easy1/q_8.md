*Problem*
Write a method that takes one argument, an array containing integers, and returns
the average of all numbers in the array. The array will never be empty and the numbers
will always be positive integers. Your result should also be an integer.

*Examples and Test Cases*
These tests should print true:
puts average([1, 6]) == 3 # integer division: (1 + 6) / 2 -> 3
puts average([1, 5, 87, 45, 8, 8]) == 25
puts average([9, 47, 23, 95, 16, 52]) == 40

*Data Structures and Algorithms*
1. initialize a local variable called 'total' with a value of 0
2. iterate over the array
3. add each element to the total variable
4. divide the total variable by the size of the array
5. return this integer

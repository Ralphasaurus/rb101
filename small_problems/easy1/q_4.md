*Problem*
Write a method that counts the number of occurrences of each element in a given array.
The words in the array are case-sensitive: 'suv' != 'SUV'. ` Once counted,
print each element alongside the number of occurrences.

Rules:
- words are case sensitive
input: an array of strings
output: a hash with the keys as the string and the value as an integer

*Examples and Test Cases*
car => 4
truck => 3
SUV => 1
motorcycle => 2

*Data Structures and Algorithms*

*Code with Intent*
 # Going to need a parameter for the input array
# 1. iterate over the array
# 2. remove an element
---add to hash method---
# 3. add it to a hash as a key
# 4. set the value of said key to 1
------------------------
# 5. move to next element
# 6. if the element is the same as an existing key increment that value by 1 
# 7. else repeat steps 3-4
# 8. repeat steps 5-7
# 9. when all elements have been evaluated return the new hash.

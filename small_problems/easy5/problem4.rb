# Given a string of words separated by spaces, write a method that takes
# this string of words and returns a string in which the first and last
# letters of every word are swapped.

# You may assume that every word contains at least one letter, and that 
# the string will always contain at least one word. You may also assume 
# that each string contains nothing but words and spaces
